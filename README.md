# Gallery

> Zero-Maintenance Photo Gallery using [hugo](https://gohugo.com) and [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

## ToDo

- [x] Deploy page using Netlify
- [x] Support GitHub uploads in `static/images/``
- [x] Display first 10 images only
- [ ] Use *lazy loading* for more than 10 images

## Usage

Put images im `static/images` and run `make build` to build the site. This works awesome with GitHub, Netlify, and common Pull Request workflow. No manual actions needed! üòç
